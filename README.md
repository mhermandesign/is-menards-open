Is Menards open in Ames, IA?

## Description

This app was made, mostly, as a joke. My town recently broke ground on a Menards store and it seemed that nobody could stop talking about it. Leading up to the opening, a common question on local forums was "When is Menards opening?"

To celebrate the end of that incessant question, I decided to keep it alive a bit longer in the form of "Is Menards open right now?"

## Goal

My goal was to create an app that found the current day and show the user the opening and closing hours for said day. In the event that the store was closed, I wanted to tell the user when they could expect the store to re-open.

## Challenges

Some of my personal challenges for this project included:

+ Working with a 24hr clock, which I always fail to wrap my head around
+ Making use of the Date() object, which was trickier than I'd expected
+ Displaying information dynamically based on multiple factors, such as "Menards is closed, but will open tomorrow at X:XXAM" or "Menards will be closing in X hour(s)".

## Next Steps

If I find the time to revisit this project, I plan on improving the following: polishing the appearance a bit and adding some QoL improvements like the current time, the weekly schedule, and
